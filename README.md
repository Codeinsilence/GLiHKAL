# GLiHKAL
Graphics Library I Have Known and Loved (preferably stylized as GLiHKAL) is a labor of love and a passion project.

The project is my attempt at showcasing a variety of real-time rendering techniques. I will be taking inspiration from my undergraduate studies, as well as some online resources.

Some OpenGL learning resources (no particular order):
- [OpenGL 4.6 Core Profile Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf)
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
- [opengl-tutorial](https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/)

Some people hate reading, but trust me, reading can save you so much time. I don't actually read through these resources from beginning to end, but they make for great references when things go wrong.

Planned features to implement (non-exhaustive):
- Lighting (Phong + Blinn-Phong)
- Shadow Mapping
- Ambient Occlusion
- Instancing
- Bloom
- Deferred shading (mutliple lights)
- HDR
- Normal Mapping
- Parallax Mapping
- Anti-Aliasing
- Particle system (support basic elements; fire, smoke, bubbles, etc.)
- Screen-space effects
